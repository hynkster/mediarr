# Mediarr - My Home Media Server Setup

Hey there! üëã This is my personal setup for running a media server at home. I've put together this collection of scripts and guides to help friends set up their own media servers using the Arr stack (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.) and Jellyfin or Plex.

## What's This All About?

This is basically everything you need to run your own Netflix-like setup at home. It'll help you:
- Stream your media anywhere in your house
- Automatically organize your movies and TV shows
- Keep track of your shows and download new episodes
- Handle media downloads cleanly and automatically

## What's Included?
- Setup scripts to get everything running
- A guide that explains how everything works
- Configuration files you can use as templates
- Tips and tricks I learned while setting this up

## Requirements
- A Linux machine or server (I use Manjaro)
- Some basic command line knowledge
- A NAS or hard drives for storage
- Basic networking knowledge (helpful but not required)

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a personal project - not professional software! It works for me, but you might need to tweak things for your setup. Feel free to ask questions or suggest improvements!

## Questions?
If you run into issues or need help, just open an issue here on GitHub. I'll help when I can!

Happy streaming! üçø
